# Metastability-Containing-Hardware-Final-Project
The project offering detailed insights into circuit behaviors, metastability issues, and logic gate performance. It serves as an educational aid in understanding and designing complex digital logic circuits and provides practical solutions for handling metastability in circuit design.

# Digital Logic Simulation and Analysis Tool

This repository contains a Python script designed for digital logic simulation, focusing on metastability detection, Boolean expression evaluation, and circuit simulation. It provides tools for detecting unstable states in digital circuits and evaluating complex Boolean expressions based on different input conditions.

## Features

- **Metastability Detection**: Detects and analyzes metastable states in digital signals to help understand circuit behaviors under conditions where signals may not settle to stable logic levels.
- **Boolean Expression Evaluation**: Uses symbolic computation to evaluate Boolean expressions with given bitsets, supporting operations like AND, OR, and NOT.
- **Circuit Simulation**: Simulates digital circuits, specifically multiplexers and logic gates, based on input conditions including metastable states.
- **Analysis and Optimization**: Calculates the number of gates and latency of simulated circuits, crucial for optimizing hardware design.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization tools for latency and gate count, aiding in the comparative analysis of circuit designs.
